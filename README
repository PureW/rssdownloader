Script for watching an rss-feed of torrents and download
any matches to a special folder.

Written by Anders Bennehag and licensed under GPL.

To run the program, create a config-file bicycles.ini:
	[torrent]
	rss: http://rss.thepiratebay.org/208
	search-string:bicycles 720p
	min-size:600
	max-size:1200
	folder: /home/anders/torrents/watch/tv-shows

and then start rssdownloader with 
	python rssdownloader.py -c bicycles.ini

The program will look through the feed once and put matching new torrents in the designated folder after which it is done. It is not a daemon which is why it must be scheduled with cron.
